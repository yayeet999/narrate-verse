# Parameter Reference Guide
## 1. Core Structure

### 1.1 Title
- Definition: The novel's name, usually reflecting its central theme or tone.
- Story Influence:
  - Serves as a conceptual anchor for the narrative's style or focus.
  - Can hint at major themes, conflicts, or the aesthetic of the setting.
- Examples:
  - "Shadows of Elysium": Implies a mysterious, possibly fantasy setting with dark undertones.
  - "City of Scattered Stars": Suggests a futuristic or cosmic scope.
- Guidance: Keep it thematically consistent with genre & style. If comedic, consider a witty/pun-based title; if dark or epic, choose something more dramatic.

### 1.2 Story Description
- Definition: A brief (~500 chars) synopsis or elevator pitch describing the novel’s core premise.
- Story Influence:
  - Guides how the opening chapters are established.
  - Specific or detailed descriptions narrow the AI’s focus; vague descriptions allow more creative latitude.
- Examples:
  - "A lone wanderer must save a crumbling kingdom."
  - "In the floating city of Atrum, a rebellious scholar uncovers a conspiracy that blurs lines between magic and technology."
- Guidance: If very detailed, mention key conflicts or a unique twist to incorporate early.

### 1.3 Novel Length
- Values: 
  - "50k-100k words"
  - "100k-150k words"
  - "150k+ words"
- Influence On Outline:
  - "50k-100k": Usually 10–20 chapters total; covers straightforward arcs.
  - "100k-150k": Expands subplots, up to ~20–30 chapters; deeper exploration.
  - "150k+": Often 30+ chapters or multi-part structure; more complex arcs.
- Examples:
  - A single-protagonist quest might fit well in 50k-100k.
  - A multi-faction epic often suits 150k+.
- Considerations: Longer lengths demand more subplots, backstory, or world detail.

### 1.4 Chapter Structure
- Values:
  - "Fixed length"
  - "Variable length"
- Story Influence:
  - Fixed: Consistent pacing and chapter size, more methodical structure.
  - Variable: Allows short, intense chapters and longer, exploratory chapters.
- Examples:
  - Each chapter is ~2,500 words, for a neat 50k total in 20 chapters.
  - Chapters may range from 1k–5k words, letting tension ebb and flow dramatically.
- Guidance: Variable can feel more dynamic, but fixed is often easier to pace for linear arcs.

### 1.5 Average Chapter Length
- Definition: Approximate word count per chapter (e.g., 2k, 3k, 5k words).
- Influence: Affects how many total chapters you’ll need for a chosen novel length.
- Examples:
  - 1,500 words → quick read, possibly suitable for fast action or YA style.
  - 4,000 words → each chapter is more in-depth, with multiple scenes or subplots.

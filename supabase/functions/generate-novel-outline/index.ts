Your task is to utilize the provided user parameters, reference guide, and weighting system to produce a highly detailed and structured chapter-by-chapter outline.

# Parameter Reference Guide
[## **1. Core Structure**

### **1.1 Title**
- **Definition**: The novel’s name, usually reflecting its central theme or tone.
- **Story Influence**:
  - Serves as a conceptual anchor for the narrative’s style or focus.
  - Can hint at major themes, conflicts, or the aesthetic of the setting.
- **Examples**:
  - *“Shadows of Elysium”*: Implies a mysterious, possibly fantasy setting with dark undertones.
  - *“City of Scattered Stars”*: Suggests a futuristic or cosmic scope.
- **Guidance**: Keep it thematically consistent with genre & style. If comedic, consider a witty/pun-based title; if dark or epic, choose something more dramatic.

### **1.2 Story Description**
- **Definition**: A brief (~500 chars) synopsis or elevator pitch describing the novel’s core premise.
- **Story Influence**:
  - Guides how the opening chapters are established.
  - Specific or detailed descriptions narrow the AI’s focus; vague descriptions allow more creative latitude.
- **Examples**:
  - *Short & Vague*: “A lone wanderer must save a crumbling kingdom.”
  - *Detailed*: “In the floating city of Atrum, a rebellious scholar uncovers a conspiracy that blurs lines between magic and technology.”
- **Guidance**: If very detailed, mention key conflicts or a unique twist to incorporate early.

### **1.3 Novel Length**
- **Values**:
  - **50k-100k words**
  - **100k-150k words**
  - **150k+ words**
- **Influence on Outline**:
  - **50k-100k**: Usually 10–20 chapters total; covers straightforward arcs.
  - **100k-150k**: Expands subplots, up to ~20–30 chapters; deeper exploration.
  - **150k+**: Often 30+ chapters or multi-part structure; more complex arcs.
- **Examples**:
  - A single-protagonist quest might fit well in **50k-100k**.
  - A multi-faction epic often suits **150k+**.
- **Considerations**: Longer lengths demand more subplots, backstory, or world detail.

### **1.4 Chapter Structure**
- **Values**:
  - **Fixed length**
  - **Variable length**
- **Story Influence**:
  - *Fixed*: Consistent pacing and chapter size, more methodical structure.
  - *Variable*: Allows short, intense chapters and longer, exploratory chapters.
- **Examples**:
  - *Fixed*: Each chapter is ~2,500 words, for a neat 50k total in 20 chapters.
  - *Variable*: Chapters may range from 1k–5k words, letting tension ebb and flow dramatically.
- **Guidance**: Variable can feel more dynamic, but fixed is often easier to pace for linear arcs.

### **1.5 Average Chapter Length** (Number)
- **Definition**: Approximate word count per chapter (e.g., 2k, 3k, 5k words).
- **Influence**:
  - Affects how many total chapters you’ll need for a chosen novel length.
  - Lower count = more (but shorter) chapters; higher count = fewer but longer chapters.
- **Examples**:
  - 1,500 words → quick read, possibly suitable for fast action or YA style.
  - 4,000 words → each chapter is more in-depth, with multiple scenes or subplots.

### **1.6 Chapter Naming Style**
- **Values**:
  - **Numbered only** (e.g., “Chapter 1”)
  - **Titled only** (e.g., “Whispers in the Fog”)
  - **Both** (“Chapter 7: Whispers in the Fog”)
- **Influence**:
  - Titled chapters can preview or highlight the chapter’s mood or focus.
  - Numbered only is more minimalistic, focusing on continuous flow.
- **Examples**:
  - If comedic, fun titles might enhance the humor.  
  - If dark, each title might be ominous or thematically consistent.

## **Practical Usage Example (Synergy Cases)**

*(Note: These synergy examples highlight how parameters might interact in the story. They do **not** include any numeric weighting formulas, just conceptual synergy.)*

1. **Dark Fantasy + High Violence (4–5) + Bittersweet Resolution**  
   - Gritty atmosphere, brutal conflicts, morally gray arcs; final outcome partly successful but overshadowed by major losses.

2. **Mystery (Detective) + Low Violence (1–2) + Multiple POVs**  
   - Puzzle structure, primarily mental conflict or tension. Multiple POVs allow glimpses of different suspects or vantage points without gore or extreme violence.

3. **Romantic Comedy + Low Profanity + Short Paragraphs**

4. **Epic Fantasy + World Complexity=5 + Cultural Depth=5**  
   - Multiple kingdoms, deep lore, many sub-factions, possibly a grand quest spanning countless pages. Characters can come from distinct cultural backgrounds, each with unique traditions.]

# Weighting System
[## **1. Advanced Architecture**

1. **Parameter Ingestion**  
  - Collect all user choices (genre, theme, setting, characters, writing style, etc.).
2. **Weighted Matrix Construction**  
  - Assign each parameter a set of numeric influences across expanded story dimensions (including new ones like Thematic Resonance).
  - Use logarithmic/exponential scaling and confidence scores.
3. **Cross-Influence Application**  
  - Multiply or add parameter influences using weighted matrices.
  - Apply decay functions for repeated parameter types or stacked intensities.
4. **Normalization & Balancing**  
  - Conduct multi-stage normalization (local dimension normalizing, then global).
  - Dynamically adjust based on total parameter count.
5. **Conflict Resolution**  
  - Identify contradictions and override them by priority or partial damping.
6. **Final Dimension Outputs**  
  - Output numeric scores for each dimension to guide outline generation.

---

## **2. Expanded Story Dimensions**

1. **Complexity**  
  - Measures subplot layering, world-building depth, political intricacies.
2. **Conflict**  
  - Measures aggressiveness, moral or physical tension, confrontation scale.
3. **Emotional Depth**  
  - Reflects introspection and relationship focus.
4. **Detail**  
  - Governs descriptive or expository content level.
5. **Tone**  
  - Spans comedic/light to dark/serious.
6. **Structural Expansion**  
  - Indicates total chapters, POVs, subplots.
7. **Pacing**  
  - Speed of events, scene length distribution.
8. **Thematic Resonance**  
  - Alignment between chosen theme, plot, and characters.
9. **Cultural Cohesion**  
  - Consistency of cultural framework with setting, dialogue, customs.
10. **Character Chemistry**  
   - Quality of inter-character relationships, synergy or tension in cast dynamics.
11. **Genre Authenticity**  
   - How strongly elements fulfill typical genre conventions or expectations.
12. **Narrative Momentum**  
   - Drive that propels the story forward, beyond simple pacing.
13. **World Integration**  
   - Degree to which setting directly affects plot and character decisions.

---

## **3. Parameter Interaction System**

1. **Weighted Multiplication Matrices**  
  - Each parameter row (e.g., "Urban Fantasy") multiplied by column dimension (e.g., "Detail," "Tone," etc.).
  - Use exponential scaling if a parameter indicates strong impact (e.g., Hard Sci-Fi might exponentially raise Complexity).
2. **Logarithmic Adjustments**  
  - For parameters above certain thresholds, apply log(1 + x) to dampen extremes.
  - E.g., if multiple "High Violence" picks appear, use diminishing returns.
3. **Confidence Scores**  
  - Each parameter or sub-parameter can store a confidence rating (0–1).
  - Multiply influences by confidence to reduce uncertain picks or highlight strongly chosen ones.
4. **Decay Functions for Stacking**  
  - If multiple parameters push the same dimension, apply Dimension = base + sum(influences) * e^(-k * stackCount).
  - Prevents run-away inflation when user selects many high-intensity parameters.

---

## **4. Complex Calculation Methods**

1. **Multi-Stage Normalization**  
  - Normalize each dimension locally (e.g., cap at 2.0).  
  - Then apply a global pass to ensure the total dimension sum doesn't exceed a set range.
2. **Conditional Weight Modifiers**  
  - If a parameter is only relevant after another parameter is above a threshold, apply conditional logic.
3. **Dynamic Range Adjustment**  
  - If user picks many extremes, shift upper caps or logs for more nuance.
4. **Parameter Saturation Limits**  
  - Prevent certain dimensions from rising beyond a maximum (e.g., no more than 2.5 in Conflict).
5. **Feedback Loops**  
  - Recalculate after conflict resolution to confirm final dimension stability.
6. **Edge Case Handling**  
  - If contradictory picks remain, override lower-priority parameters or clamp them to median values.

---

## **5. Genre-Specific Frameworks**

1. **Custom Baselines**  
  - Each major genre modifies dimension weighting thresholds (e.g., Mystery might always raise Conflict baseline).
2. **Genre-Specific Patterns**  
  - High Fantasy: Increased Complexity/Detail, potential slower Pacing.
  - Romance: Higher Emotional Depth, Character Chemistry emphasis.
  - Sci-Fi: Elevated Complexity, Genre Authenticity requires scientific plausibility.
3. **Threshold Values**  
  - If user picks certain subgenres (Hard Sci-Fi), multiply Complexity by an exponential factor.
4. **Success Metrics**  
  - For Thrillers, Conflict dimension must stay above a defined level to remain authentic.
5. **Required Element Minimums**  
  - E.g., Epic Fantasy must not have Complexity < 1.0 after calculations.

---

## **6. Enhanced Formulas (Illustrative)**

Let `p_i` be the set of parameter influences in dimension `d`. Let `C_i` be confidence scores. Let `stackCount` track repeated influences. Let `G_f(d)` be genre factor for dimension `d`.

1. **Base Summation**
  dimension_d = Σ( p_i * C_i )

2. **Weighted Multiplication**
  dimension_d = dimension_d * G_f(d)

3. **Logarithmic Damping**
  if dimension_d > threshold:
      dimension_d = threshold + log( dimension_d - threshold + 1 )

4. **Decay for Stacking**
  dimension_d = dimension_d * e^( -k * (stackCount - 1) )

5. **Normalization**
  dimension_d = min( dimension_d, maxAllowed )

6. **Genre Authenticity Check**
  - If dimension_d < genre's min requirement, raise it to that min.

---

## **7. Conflict Resolution and Priorities**

1. **Rank** parameters (e.g., Content Controls > Genre/Theme > Setting/Style > Others).
2. **If Contradiction**:  
  - Lower-priority parameter is scaled or overridden.  
  - Recalculate dimension values.  
3. **Lock** final results to produce stable dimension outputs.

---

## **8. Outputting Final Dimensions**

1. **Thematic Resonance**: e.g., R = 1 + sum( themeFactors ) * e^( -k * mismatch )  
2. **Cultural Cohesion**: Based on setting type, cultural depth, frameworks.  
3. **Character Chemistry**: Summed arcs for relationships, dampened by conflict overrides.  
4. **Narrative Momentum**: Weighted measure from Pacing, Conflict, Emotional arcs.  
5. **World Integration**: Weighted from Setting Type, Complexity, synergy with plot elements.

---

## **9. Example Execution**

**User** picks "High Fantasy" + "150k+ words" + "Coming of Age" + "Theme=Good vs Evil" + "Violence=4."  
1. **Initial** influences (e.g., High Fantasy: Complexity baseline 1.2, detail baseline 0.8, log damp if above 2).  
2. **Add** theme Coming of Age (Emotional Depth) + Good vs Evil (Conflict).  
3. **Apply** exponential factor for "150k+ words" on Structural Expansion.  
4. **Check** violence=4 raises Conflict but saturates at 2.0.  
5. **Normalize**.  
6. **Final** dimension: Complexity~1.8, Conflict~2.0, Emotional~1.5, Structural~2.1, ThematicResonance≥1.5, etc.

---

## **10. Implementation Flow**

1. **Parse** user input.  
2. **Fetch** parameter influences, including confidence scores from DB.  
3. **Compute** dimension values with the advanced formulas.  
4. **Resolve** contradictions, re-normalize.  
5. **Produce** final dimension matrix.  
6. **Use** that matrix to generate outline details.]
